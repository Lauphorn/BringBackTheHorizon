Hi!

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

IMPORTANT!

To achieve the same graphics as in the video demo and screenshots you have to be sure that you:
1. Set your project to Deferred Rendering Path (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Rendering Path: Deferred);
2. Set your project Color Space to Linear (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Color Space: Linear);
3. Switch your camera to HDR mode (Checkbox in the camera component);
4. Download and use the Post Processing pack from the Package Manager and use it with the provided post-processing profile (placed at \Assets\HQ_ResidentialHouse\DemoScene)

To use the HDRP or URP version of the pack, please look at the Upgrade to HDRP or URP instructions file placed at the root folder of the pack.

That's all!
