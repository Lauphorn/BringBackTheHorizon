2.1.0
Added support for the Universal Render Pipeline's integrated post processing. (Uninstall Post Processing package and re-run installer to make use of this).

Ported effects:
- Blur
- Edge Detection
- LUT
- Scanlines
- Sharpen
- Sketch
- Sunshafts

More effects will follow through consecutive updates. 

Note that the URP doesn't support custom effects to be executed before built-in effects are, because of this LUT will "mute" the Bloom effect. 

Added:
- Radius parameter to Sharpen effect

2.0.0
Minimum required version is now 2019.1.0. Only Post Processing installed through Package Manager is now supported.

DO NOT UPDATE IN EXISTING PROJECTS! Effects will be removed from profiles in any event. Requires to delete SC Post Effects folder before importing!

To ensures compatibility with future Unity versions, folder structure has been changed. This also required to set the minimum compatible version at 2019.1.0

Changed:
- Package now uses an assembly definition
- Default settings for effect now render them invisible. Eg: "opacity" or "intensity" values are 0 by default. 
  This ensures volumes can be faded out, without needing a "base" volume with the effect added in a disabled state.
- The "SCPE" scripting define symbol is no longer necessary and can safely be removed.

Fixed:
- Effects not saving to profiles in Unity 2020.1+, causing them to be removed when Unity closes

Removed:
- Invert color effect, now incorporated into Color Grading LUT effect

1.0.2
Added:
- Tilt Shift
	* Area falloff parameter
	* Performance and Appearance quality modes
	* Debug mode (visualizes the blur area)
- Fog
	* Directional Light color support, creates a faux-atmospheric scattering effect.

Changed:
- Installer restricts Post Processing package to version 2.1.7. Newer versions introduce a bug affecting custom effects.

Fixed:
- LUT, compiler error when building project using OpenGL on MacOS
- Ripples and Pixelize effects no longer increase in strength in a diagonal direction (thanks to user Johannes)

1.0.1
2019.2 compatibility verified. Note that 2019.1+ requires the LWRP/HDRP for VR compatibility.

Fixed:
- LUT
	* Compiler error when building for OpenGLES platforms (mobile platforms remain unsupported, but this at least resolves the error)
- Fog
	* Radial toggle not taking effect when the gradient texture color mode is used

1.0.0
Initial version, read the full details here: http://staggart.xyz/sc-post-effects-leaves-beta

- When using Unity 2018.1+, the installation screen no longer accepts a GitHub installation of the Post Processing Stack. The Package Manager must be used. Existing projects will not be affected.
- Revised demo scene, now showcases almost every effect. Certain environment effects remain excluded since these need a larger context to showcase.
- Documentation is now complete. All effects now feature a documentation button in their inspector, which opens the corresponding web page.
- Some variable names have been alterated for consistency, excisting volume settings may have to be re-adjusted
- Gradient textures with incorrect import settings will now display a warning and "Fix" button in the inspector.
- Remote package version checking now happens asynchronously and won't stall the installer or help window GUI on slow connections or time-outs.
- Some effects will now show the chosen solver or method in the title name when overridden

Changed:
- Dithering
	* No longer uses a procedural dithering matrix, but uses a 32x32 texture instead. Allowing for greater variety at faster speeds. Several sample textures have been added.
- Fog
	* Color parameter now allows for HDR values, enabling emissive fog
- Sunshafts
	* SunshaftCaster component now has an "infinite distance" toggle, to more accuractly match a skybox's sun position
- Cloud Shadows
	* Now samples a texture's Red channel, for easier texture creation
- Refraction 
	* Minor visual improvement to usage with normal maps. 
- Colorize
	* Now executes after the stack so it takes tonemapping into account
- Kuwahara
	* Distance field is now hidden when method is set to "Regular"
	* Minor shader optimization

Fixed:
- Fog
	* Added skybox color mode support for LWRP 5.7.2+ up to Unity 2019.1.2f1. Existing installations using LWRP need to re-run the installation to activate this. Which can be done through the Help window.
- Refraction 
	* Normal map offsetting entire screen in Unity 2017.2 and newer
- Gradient
	* Not respecting alpha values set in color fields, resulting in incorrect opacity behaviour
- Hue Shift 3D
	* Precision artifacts when running the effect for a long period of time
- Color Grading LUT
	* Extracter storing the scene's luminance in the screenshot's alpha channel when using FXAA
- Pixelize
	* Was not taking the screen's aspect ratio into account. Pixels will now always be square. (Note: your existing profiles need to be re-adjusted!)
- Blur
	* (Potential fix) Sometimes receiving the name "Amount" or "Length" when added to the stack
- Lens Flares
	* Corrected behaviour of Threshold parameter in both Linear and Gamma color spaces
- Light Streaks
	* Corrected behaviour of Threshold parameter in both Linear and Gamma color spaces
- Sunshafts
	* Intensity parameter not working with volume blending (Note: your current intensity values need to be re-adjusted!)
